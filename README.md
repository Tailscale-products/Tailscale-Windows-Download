## 🧠 Overview  

**Tailscale** is a modern networking tool that allows you to securely connect your devices into a private network, no matter where they are located. Laptops, desktops, servers, and mobile devices can communicate as if they were on the same local network—without manual VPN setup or complex firewall rules.

Built on WireGuard-based technology, Tailscale emphasizes ease of use and strong security. Devices authenticate through trusted identity providers, and encrypted connections are established automatically, removing much of the traditional networking complexity.

On Windows systems, Tailscale runs quietly in the background, providing reliable and secure access with minimal user intervention.
